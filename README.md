Installation
------------
Download the NAO Communicator Android application from https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.robotik.nao.communicator

After that open the app an scan for your NAO. If the app cannot find it, add AOs ip (IPv4 only) manually. After that touch down and hold on your NAO in the list. Now you can install the remote server with a click on the install button on the right upper corner of the app.

After server installation you can connect to the NAO by tapping your NAO in the list.
If you want to use animations and tracker, download the Choregraphe programs from https://github.com/NorthernStars/NAO-Communication-server/tree/master/NAO%20Communicator%20Server/choregraphe
and upload them to you NAO. Don't forget to mark them as default.
